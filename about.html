							<p>Aperi Animam is a Milwaukee Area mixed voice ensemble consisting of 12 artists of various backgrounds. With a focus on music from the Renaissance, Middle Ages, and Early Baroque periods, Aperi Animam strives to recapture the undiluted purity of tone that embodies the era. Examples of repertoire included works from Composers such as Thomas Tallis, William Byrd, Palestrina, and Josquin des Prez. </p>

							<p>Translating to “open your soul”, Aperi Animam aims to use simple yet expressive singing to provide an environment of stimulated meditation and reflection. </p>

						
							<h3>Danny Koplitz, Artistic Director</h3>

							<p>Daniel is in his fourth year of undergraduate study at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee in vocal performance. There he has an additional focus in choral conducting as well as language and linguistics. He sings with the university’s flagship ensemble Concert Chorale and has sang with the Men’s Chorus and Collegium Musicum. Currently, Daniel is employed as a choral scholar by the Cathedral of All Saints, but also frequently has solo and ensemble work with Plymouth Chorale and the Milwaukee Children’s Choir. Most recently, Daniel premiered Sam Mullooly’s opera “American Spring,” upon his return from the Early Music Academy in Boston and the Madison Early Music Festival in Madison, WI. His favorite past roles include Autumn in Purcell’s <em>The Fairy Queen</em>, Aesculapius Carboy in Sullivan’s <em>The Zoo</em>, and Bobby Child in the Gershwin adaptation <em>Crazy for You</em>.</p>

							<p>After graduation, Daniel intends on seeking out a master’s program in early music performance and musicology, however, he is in no rush to leave Milwaukee. He finds that APERI ANIMAM is filling a niche in the area and hopes to continue to cultivate the emerging ensemble and enrich the thriving arts community. When Daniel isn’t looking over manuscripts in candlelight, you can find him sipping on some dark roast coffee or capturing light with his Nikon D3100.</p>

							<p>Contralto Jackie Willis is both a singer and Administrative Director of Aperi Animam. She is employed with Milwaukee Opera Theatre, The United Methodist Church of Whitefish Bay, as well as Academy of Performing Arts as a piano and voice teacher. Favorite roles include appearances as Stag/Turtledove in <em>Handel’s Bestiary</em> with Milwaukee Opera Theatre, Third Lady in <em>Zie Magic Flute</em> with Milwaukee Opera Theatre, Suzuki in Puccini’s <em>Madama Butterfly</em> with La Musica Lirica, and First Witch/Enchantress from Purcell’s <em>Dido and Aenaes</em> with UWM Opera Theatre. You also may have seen her as a chorus member in Ravel’s <em>L’enfant et les sortileges</em>, a collaboration between Milwaukee Opera Theatre and UWM Opera Theatre. She recently made her debut as Choreographer for UWM Opera Theatre’s <em>Dido and Aeneas</em> and <em>Amahl and the Night Visitors</em> with Bayshore Lutheran along with her first directing opportunity for UWM Opera Theatre’s scene presentation of <em>“Recit-A-What?!”</em>.  Jackie is a graduate of UW-Milwaukee and received her Bachelor of Arts degree in Vocal Performance in December of 2016. She is actively seeking graduate school or her next path in life, but isn’t in a hurry to leave Milwaukee.</p>

							<p> When Jackie isn’t devoting her time to early music and opera you can find her exploring local coffee shops, dancing, reading, or daydreaming about future travels. </p>
