						<h2>About Us</h2>
						<span class="image fit">

						</span>
						<p>Consisting of artists from varying backgrounds, APERI ANIMAM is a newly formed mixed voice ensemble located in Milwaukee,
							WI. With a focus on music from the Renaissance, Middle Ages, and Early Baroque periods, the ensemble strives to recapture
							the undiluted purity of tone that embodies the era. Examples of repertoire include works from composers such as Thomas Tallis,
							William Byrd, Palestrina, and Josquin des Prez. </p>
						
						<p>Translating to “open your soul”, APERI ANIMAM aims to use simple yet expressive singing to provide an environment of stimulated
							meditation and reflection. </p>

						<p>Daniel is in his fourth year of undergraduate study at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee in vocal performance.
							There he has an additional focus in choral conducting as well as language and linguistics. He sings with the university’s
							flagship ensemble Concert Chorale and has sang with the Men’s Chorus and Collegium Musicum. Currently, Daniel is employed
							as a choral scholar by the Cathedral of All Saints, but also frequently has solo and ensemble work with Plymouth Chorale
							and the Milwaukee Children’s Choir. Most recently, Daniel premiered Sam Mullooly’s opera “American Spring,” upon his
							return from the Early Music Academy in Boston and the Madison Early Music Festival in Madison, WI. His favorite past
							roles include Autumn in Purcell’s
							<em>The Fairy Queen</em>, Aesculapius Carboy in Sullivan’s
							<em>The Zoo</em>, and Bobby Child in the Gershwin adaptation
							<em>Crazy for You</em>.</p>
	
						<p>After graduation, Daniel intends on seeking out a master’s program in early music performance and musicology, however,
							he is in no rush to leave Milwaukee. He finds that APERI ANIMAM is filling a niche in the area and hopes to continue
							to cultivate the emerging ensemble and enrich the thriving arts community. When Daniel isn’t looking over manuscripts
							in candlelight, you can find him sipping on some dark roast coffee or capturing light with his Nikon D3100.</p>

							division and recently made her debut as Choreographer for UWM Opera Theatre’s
							<em>Dido &amp; Æneas</em> and

							scene presentation of “Recit-A-What?!”. She is a graduate of UW-Milwaukee and received her Bachelor of Arts degree
							in Vocal Performance in December of 2016. She is actively seeking graduate school or her next path in life, but is
							currently embracing the Milwaukee artistic community.</p>
	
						<p> When Jackie isn’t devoting her time to early music and opera you can find her exploring local coffee shops, dancing,
							reading, or daydreaming about future travels.</p>
