						<p>Consisting of artists from varying backgrounds, APERI ANIMAM is a newly formed mixed voice ensemble located in Milwaukee,
							WI. With a focus on music from the Renaissance, Middle Ages, and Early Baroque periods, the ensemble strives to recapture
							the undiluted purity of tone that embodies the era. Examples of repertoire include works from composers such as Thomas Tallis,
							William Byrd, Palestrina, and Josquin des Prez. </p>
						
						<p>Translating to “open your soul”, APERI ANIMAM aims to use simple yet expressive singing to provide an environment of stimulated
							meditation and reflection. </p>

						<p>DANIEL KOPLITZ, baritone, is a soloist, ensemble singer, and conductor based in Milwaukee. In the spring of 2018, Daniel graduated at the top of his class from the Peck School of the Arts at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee with a degree in vocal performance. During his studies, he had emphases in linguistics, choral conducting, and music history, but he has also furthered his education outside of academia by attending various summer programs such as the Madison Early Music Festival (2016 - 2018), Boston Early Music Academy (2017 - 2018), and the Amherst Early Music Festival’s Ensemble Singing Intensive (2018). In addition, he has begun training under the Estill Voice Model, a research-based approach to vocal pedagogy. Some of Daniel’s past ensemble experience includes participation in the UWM Concert Chorale, the Wisconsin Collegiate Honors Choir, and Vox Antiqua, while some of his past solo engagements include Autumn (<em>The Fairy Queen</em>), the tenor soloist in Vivaldi’s <em>Magnificat</em>, and Aesculapius Carboy (<em>The Zoo</em>).
							</p>
	
						<p>Currently, Daniel is employed by All Saints’ Cathedral as a choral scholar, a post he has held since 2014. Here, he has been immersed in Anglican liturgical practice, and it was in this position where his love for early sacred music was fostered. Subsequently in January of 2017, he founded the vocal early music ensemble APERI ANIMAM, of which he is the artistic director. Daniel is also the director of The Choristers, the resident children and youth choir at St. Mark’s Episcopal Church. In the future, he hopes to obtain graduate and doctoral degrees in musicology.
