						<h2>About Us</h2>

						</header>
						<p>APERI ANIMAM was conceived in January 2017 as an outlet to explore the early music repertory and to revive its presence in Milwaukee. Meeting once a week on Monday evenings, it seemed appropriate to show their work, and they gave their first concert that May at All Saints’ Cathedral. The concert was received with great praise, and since then, they have been increasingly sought out as a historical performance ensemble in the Greater Milwaukee area.
						</p>
						
						<p>From their conception, artistic director Daniel Koplitz has encouraged a collaborative and intimate approach to interpretation and rarely conducts in performance. The ensemble rehearses as chamber musicians with a strong focus on cultural context, conveyance of text, and pure vocal quality. They aim to present this music in a manner that is both historically informed and relatable to the modern listener. Their programming is experiential, involving choral movement, spatialization, and interdisciplinary art.
						</p>

						<p>The ensemble has collaborated with Milwaukee Opera Theatre, the Plymouth Chorale, the Milwaukee Art Museum, and Early Music Now. They have performed through the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee’s Peck School of the Arts and have also been featured twice on Milwaukee’s emerging artist festival, the Milwaukee Fringe Festival. Most recently, APERI ANIMAM opened for the world-renowned Flanders Recorder Quartet and worked in a masterclass setting with the British vocal ensemble The Queen’s Six.

						<p>DANIEL KOPLITZ, baritone, is a soloist, ensemble singer, and conductor based in Milwaukee. In the spring of 2018, Daniel graduated at the top of his class from the Peck School of the Arts at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee with a degree in vocal performance. During his studies, he had emphases in linguistics, choral conducting, and music history, but he has also furthered his education outside of academia by attending various summer programs such as the Madison Early Music Festival (2016 - 2018), Boston Early Music Academy (2017 - 2018), and the Amherst Early Music Festival’s Ensemble Singing Intensive (2018). In addition, he has begun training under the Estill Voice Model, a research-based approach to vocal pedagogy. Some of Daniel’s past ensemble experience includes participation in the UWM Concert Chorale, the Wisconsin Collegiate Honors Choir, and Vox Antiqua, while some of his past solo engagements include Autumn (<em>The Fairy Queen</em>), the tenor soloist in Vivaldi’s <em>Magnificat</em>, and Aesculapius Carboy (<em>The Zoo</em>).
							</p>
	
						<p>Currently, Daniel is employed by All Saints’ Cathedral as a choral scholar, a post he has held since 2014. Here, he has been immersed in Anglican liturgical practice, and it was in this position where his love for early sacred music was fostered. Subsequently in January of 2017, he founded the vocal early music ensemble APERI ANIMAM, of which he is the artistic director. Daniel is also the director of The Choristers, the resident children and youth choir at St. Mark’s Episcopal Church. In the future, he hopes to obtain graduate and doctoral degrees in musicology.
