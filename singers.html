									<h3>Sarah Ann Mellström</h3>
									<div class="container-flex">
										<div class="text-flex">										
										
											<p>Sarah Ann Mellström was born and raised in the small town of Northfield Minnesota. Her favorite activities as a child and adult were and remain singing, dancing, reading, writing and language. Sarah has been involved in musical ensembles and physical theater since an early age and is increasingly thrilled to improve the technique and passion required for sharing these gifts. Sarah departed for Austria at the age of seventeen and was entranced by ancient music, theater, and foreign languages. Since then she has lived and worked in seven different countries and now calls Milwaukee home. She is blessed to sing with Aperi Animam this coming year and assist in reviving a spiritual tradition which enlightens those who bear witness!</p>
